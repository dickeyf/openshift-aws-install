# Overview

This repository contains instructions to deploy RedHat Openshift on nodes running in AWS.

These instructions relies mostly on scripts that automates much of the host preparation steps :
* Register the RHEL hosts with a subscription
* Activate the proper yum repositories for Openshift
* Install all the pre-requisites to prepare the hosts for the Openshift Advanced installation procedure which relies on Ansible

# Prerequisites

All VMs created must be using the latest RHEL AMI.

* RHEL subscription for Openshift 
* At least one master VM.  The masters shall be `t2.xlarge` VMs.
* At least one node VM.  The nodes shall be `t2.large` VMs.
* All VMs must have at least 30 gigs of root storage.
* All VMs must have one EBS attached on sdb.  That EBS must have at least 30 gig of space.
* All VMs must have one Elastic IP attached.

DNS entries must also be configured because Openshift routes rely on DNS hostnames to route HTTP/HTTPS requests.
The DNS entries must be in the same subdomain.  For example, <subdomain> in below's table could be substituted with 
`openshift.example.com`.

| DNS Entry                                                   | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <subdomain> IN A <master node elastic IP>                   | This hostname will be used to access openshift's web console      |
| *.<subdomain> IN A <master node elastic IP>                 | Routes matching this wildcard will be resolved to the router's IP |
| master.<subdomain> IN A <master node elastic IP>            | Master node public hostname                                       |
| node1.<subdomain> IN A <Node 1 elastic IP>                  | Node1 public hostname                                             |
| node2.<subdomain> IN A <Node 2 elastic IP>                  | Node2 public hostname                                             |
| master.internal.<subdomain> IN A <master node private IP>   | Master node private hostname                                      |
| node1.internal.<subdomain> IN A <master node private IP>    | Node1 private hostname                                            |
| node2.internal.<subdomain> IN A <master node private IP>    | Node2 private hostname                                            |

# Instructions

## Checkout this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SolaceDev/openshift-VMR-howto.git
cd openshift-VMR-howto/openshift-install
```

## Preparing the hosts for Openshift Installation

The RHEL hosts will have to be registered with a Redhat subscription that have access to Openshift Enterprise and have the
proper packages installed.  The setupHosts.sh script will prompt you for your subscriptions credentials, and then automate
these steps :
* Register the hosts with your RHEL subscriptions
* Only activate the repositories for Openshift Enterprise
* Install the required RPMs
* Setup Docker storage backend to use the EBS block device

Before proceeding, you will have to copy the AWS host's ssh private to this directory in a filename named `id_rsa`.
This will allow the scripts to login on the hosts.

This command will invoke the script which automates the above steps.  Note that there is no limit on how many hosts you
can prepare.  The scripts is host role agnostic, so hosts can be in the list in any order whether there are master or not :
```
./prepareHosts.sh <AWS Host 1 Elastic IP> <AWS Host 2 Elastic IP> <AWS Host 3 Elastic IP> <...>
```

Input your account username and password for your RHEL subscription.  Then, you should see the script making progress.

## Create the Ansible inventory hosts file

The inventory file is created with the help of a script which will prompt you to collect information about the nodes.

```
./createInventory.sh
```

You will need to provide the public and private hostname for all nodes.  You will also need to provide the
default subdomain for routes.

## Deploy Openshift

Once the inventory file is created it is now possible to deploy Openshift.  The deploy.sh script will ssh to the
master node and execute the Ansible playbook to install Openshift on all nodes.

```
./deploy.sh <masterNode IP or hostname>
```

You should see Ansible making progress installing Openshift.

Once this is complete you should be able to connect to the web console at : `https://<master node hostname>:8443`
